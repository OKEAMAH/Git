(** Type representing frozen deposits for a cycle.

    It is used both for frozen deposits and unstaked frozen deposits with
    slightly different behaviours.

    [initial_amount] is the amount on which slashing should be based.
    [current_amount] is the current amount after slashing has happened. 

    For frozen deposits, a single record is maintained with the invariant
    [initial_amount = current_amount] at the beginning of a cycle.

    For unstaked frozen deposits, there is a record per cycle. 
    The values of all unslashable cycles are squashed together at cycle ends.
    The [initial_amount] may be increased during the current cycle only, when
    an unstake is requested.

    TODO #5788: possibly rename fields
