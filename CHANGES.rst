Development Changelog
'''''''''''''''''''''

**NB:** The changelog for releases can be found at: https://tezos.gitlab.io/CHANGES.html


This file lists the changes added to each version of octez-node,
octez-client, and the other Octez executables. The changes to the economic
protocol are documented in the ``docs/protocols/`` directory; in
particular in ``docs/protocols/alpha.rst``.

When you make a commit on master, you can add an item in one of the
following subsections (node, client, â€¦) to document your commit or the
set of related commits. This will ensure that this change is not
forgotten in the final changelog, which can be found in ``docs/CHANGES.rst``.
By having your commits update this file you also make it easy to find the
commits which are related to your changes using ``git log -p -- CHANGES.rst``.
Relevant items are moved to ``docs/CHANGES.rst`` after each release.

Only describe changes which affect users (bug fixes and new features),
or which will affect users in the future (deprecated features),
not refactorings or tests. Changes to the documentation do not need to
be documented here either.

General
-------

Node
----

- Bump RPCs ``POST ../helpers/parse/operations``, ``POST
  ../helpers/scripts/run_operation`` and ``POST
  ../helpers/scripts/simulate_operation`` default version to version ``1``.
  Version ``0`` can still be used with ``?version=0`` argument. (MR :gl:`!9840`)

- **Breaking change** Removed the deprecated ``endorsing_rights`` RPC,
  use ``attestation_rights`` instead. (MR :gl:`!9849`)

- Bump RPCs ``GET ../mempool/monitor_operations``, ``POST
  ../helpers/preapply/operations``, ``GET ../blocks/<block>``, ``GET
  ../blocks/<blocks>/metadata``. and ``GET ../blocks/<blocks>/operations``
  default version to version ``1``. Version ``0`` can still be used with
  ``?version=0`` argument. (MR :gl:`!9839`)

- Bump RPC ``GET ../mempool/pending_operations`` default version to version
  ``2``. Version ``0`` has been removed and version ``1`` can still be used
  with ``?version=1`` argument. (MR :gl:`!9839`)

- Added metrics about distributed data base messages sent, broadcasted or received

- **Breaking change** Removed the deprecated
  ``disable-mempool-precheck`` configuration flag and
  ``disable_precheck`` field of ``prevalidator`` in the shell limits
  of the configuration file. They already had no effect on the node
  anymore. (MR :gl:`!10030`)

- **Breaking change** Bumped the Octez snapshot version from ``5`` to
  ``6`` to explicit the incompatibility with previous version
  nodes. Also, improved the consistency of ``snapshot`` import errors
  messages (MR :gl:`!10138`)

- Introduced a new process, forked by the node, that is responsible of
  managing the RPC server: the RPC-process. It is used by default by
  the node.

- Introduced a new ``--local-rpc-addr`` that starts the RPC server
  locally, not using the dedicated RPC-process.

- Add logs at ``Info`` level about the disconnection reasons in the p2p section.

- **Breaking change** ``GET /monitor/applied_blocks`` and ``GET
  /monitor/validated_blocks`` RPCs does not return block operations anymore.

- Add ``GET /monitor/full_applied_blocks`` and ``GET
  /monitor/full_validated_blocks`` these RPCs are similar to ``GET
  /monitor/applied_blocks`` and ``GET /monitor/validated_blocks`` but returns
  block operations as long as block header and hash.

Client
------

- For the protocols that support it, added an
  ``operation_with_legacy_attestation_name`` and
  ``operation_with_legacy_attestation_name.unsigned`` registered encodings that
  support legacy ``endorsement`` kind instead of ``attestation``. (MR
  :gl:`!9832`)

- Fixed indentation of the stacks outputted by the ``normalize stack``
  command. (MR :gl:`!9944`)

Docker Images
-------------

- The rollup node is protocol agnostic and released as part of the Docker
  image. (MR :gl:`!10086`)


Smart Rollup node
-----------------

- A new bailout mode that solely cements and defends existing
  commitments without publishing new ones. Recovers bonds when
  possible, after which the node exits gracefully. (MR :gl:`!9721`, MR
  :gl:`!9817`, MR :gl:`!9835`)

- RPC ``/global/block/<block-id>/simulate`` accepts inputs with a new optional
  field ``"log_kernel_debug_file"`` which allows to specify a file in which
  kernel logs should be written (this file is in
  ``<data-dir>/simulation_kernel_logs``). (MR :gl:`!9606`)

- The protocol specific rollup nodes binaries are now deprecated and replaced
  by symbolic links to the protocol agnostic rollup node. In the future, the
  symbolic links will be removed. (MR :gl:`!10086`)

- Released the protocol agnostic rollup node ``octez-smart-rollup-node`` as part
  of the Octez distribution. (MR :gl:`!10086`)

Smart Rollup client
-------------------

Smart Rollup WASM Debugger
--------------------------

- Added flag ``--no-kernel-debug`` to deactivate the kernel debug messages. (MR
  :gl:`!9813`)

- Support special directives using ``write_debug`` host function in the
  profiler, prefixed with ``__wasm_debugger__::``. Support
  ``start_section(<data>)`` and ``end_section(<data>)`` to count ticks in
  specific sections. (:gl:`!10149`)
