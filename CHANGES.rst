Development Changelog
'''''''''''''''''''''

**NB:** The changelog for releases can be found at: https://tezos.gitlab.io/CHANGES.html


This file lists the changes added to each version of octez-node,
octez-client, and the other Octez executables. The changes to the economic
protocol are documented in the ``docs/protocols/`` directory; in
particular in ``docs/protocols/alpha.rst``.

When you make a commit on master, you can add an item in one of the
following subsections (node, client, â€¦) to document your commit or the
set of related commits. This will ensure that this change is not
forgotten in the final changelog, which can be found in ``docs/CHANGES.rst``.
By having your commits update this file you also make it easy to find the
commits which are related to your changes using ``git log -p -- CHANGES.rst``.
Relevant items are moved to ``docs/CHANGES.rst`` after each release.

Only describe changes which affect users (bug fixes and new features),
or which will affect users in the future (deprecated features),
not refactorings or tests. Changes to the documentation do not need to
be documented here either.

General
-------

Node
----

- **Breaking Changes**: Improved a few lib_shell logs in default level by
  shortening the display to completion time only instead of the full status of
  the operation.

- Added an option ``daily-logs`` to file-descriptor sinks, enabling
  log rotation based on a daily frequency.

- Fixed a bug while reconstructing the storage after a snapshot import
  that would result in wrong context hash mapping for some blocks.

- Added an option ``create-dirs`` to file-descriptor sinks to allow
  the node to create the log directory and its parents if they don't exist.

- Added a default node configuration that enables disk logs as a
  file-descriptor-sink in the data directory of the node with a 7 days rotation.

- **Breaking Change**: Removed section in stdout logs lines

- Removed the ``indexing-strategy`` option from the ``TEZOS_CONTEXT``
  environment variable to prevent the usage of the ``always``
  indexing strategy. For now, only the ``minimal`` indexing strategy
  is allowed.

Client
------

Baker
-----

- Fixed a bug where the baker could count an (pre)endorsement twice
  while waiting for a (pre)quorum.

- Added the ability in the baker to watch for late Tenderbake
  pre-quorums to help resolve situations where part of the network is
  locked on a specific value and the other part keeps on reproposing
  fresh blocks hence slowing down the chain.
