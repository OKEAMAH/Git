This directory illustrates the two ways of writing a "literate" Ott
definition.  

The first (test10.pdf, generated from test10.ott) uses Ott to generate
a complete .tex file.  One can add comments {{ com ... }} and
tex-embed blocks (embed {{ tex ... }}) in various places.  Sometimes
this is enough, but it's not very flexible.  The tex-embed blocks can
only usefully be used in limited places, and one is stuck with the
original order of the definitions.

The second (test10-wrapper.pdf, generated from test10.ott and
test10-wrapper.tex) uses Ott to generate a .tex file of definitions
(test10-inc.tex) and includes those in a hand-written document
(test10-wrapper.tex).  This lets one quote parts of the grammar and
rule definitions as needed, in any order; it's usually the best way to
do things.
