(**
  A bloom filter can be seen as a probabilistic set. As such, the order of
  its elements is not important.

  Blocks contain a bloom filter with the union of all topics in their logs,
  together with the address of the contract that produced them.
  The [getLogs] RPC defines a filter (not to be confused with bloom filter)
  which may contain a pattern of topics to be matched with a log.

  A pattern is defined as: [pattern := TOPIC | NULL | TOPIC list]

  Where [NULL] is a wildcard, and a list of topics matches against any of the
  elements in the list ([Or]).

  To speed up the filtering, we compute a bloom filter corresponding to the
  filter's pattern. The goal is to check if this bloom is contained in the
  block's bloom, and only fetching the block in that case.
  Therefore, our filter must always be included in filters corresponding
  to blocks that have at least a log that matches with the pattern.
  For this reason, we decide to ignore [Or] patterns in the bloom filter
  "heuristic" (including all topics would break the previous property).
  If this becomes a serious bottleneck, we could keep a collection of bloom
  filters to represent the disjunction.
*)

(** Saner representation of an input filter:
    [from_block] and [to_block] are defined by:
    A filter's [from_block] and [to_block] if provided, or
    a filter's [block_hash] if provided ([from_block = to_block = block_n]), or
    [from_block = to_block = latest block's number].

    A [bloom] filter is computed using the topics and address.
