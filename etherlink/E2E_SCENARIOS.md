Repo: https://github.com/trilitech/live-testing-protocols/tree/main

## Scenario 4: conventional NFT dApp

## Scenario 5: the Uniswap v2 DeFi protocol

## Scenario 6: interactions with Foundry

## Scenario 7: interactions with Hardhat

## Scenario 8: interactions with Remix

## Scenario 9: interactions with MetaMask

Basic scenario using MetaMask wallet to send transactions on the Etherlink network.

There is no code for this specific scenario.

### Actions:

 1. User can use the Etherlink network on MetaMask
    * The Etherlink network can be added directly on MetaMask
    * User can see his balance of XTZ on the wallet
 2. User can send simple transactions
    * User can send to himself (or somebody else) some XTZ from the MetaMask interface
    * User can see his transaction on the Blockscout explorer
 3. User can use MetaMask on a dApp with Etherlink network
    * User can connect on a dApp (I recommend Blockscout or the dApp form scenario 4) with MetaMask
    * User can interact with the dApp and send transactions

There is no code for the Actions.

### Manually testing the MR
