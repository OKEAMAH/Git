### Features

- Implement Call stipend for inner call with transfer. (!11587)
- Support 'modexp' precompiled contract. (!11732)

### Bug fixes

- Fix minimum gas price used for charging fees: should be `base_fee_per_gas`, instead of `1 wei`. (!11509)
- Fix an overflow bug when prepaying transactions/repaying gas. (!11545)
- Fix a bug where creating a create a contract with not enough funds was allowed. (!11526)
- Hands the return to the current context when the creation of a contract fails. (!11546)
- Fix a bug where for non-existing address default hash was used rather than zero hash. (!11665)
- Fix a bug where nonce and code shouldn't be set when SELFDESTRUCT is called
  in initialisation code. (!11637)
- Fix a bug where SELFDESTRUCT deletes contracts immediately rather than at the end of the transaction. (!11658)

### Breaking changes

- Prefix withdrawal precompiled contract by 'ff' to avoid any friction with upcoming Ethereum fork.
  Withdrawal contract address is now 'ff00000000000000000000000000000000000001'. (!11556)

- Prevent collision when creating a contract at the same level it was self-
  destructed. (!11474)

### Bug fixes

### Breaking changes

### Internal

- Added support for multi-testing to the `evm-evaluation`. (!11223)
- Blueprints are now stored, the Queue is simplified. New storage version (3). (!11131)

## Version 32f957d52ace920916d54b9f02a2d32ee30e16b3

### Features

- Support precompiled contract `ecrecover`. (!10926)

### Bug fixes

- Fix the memory limit of the runtime, which is now of the maximum size
  addressable considering the limits of the WASM PVM (32bits, which means `2^32`
  bytes addressable). (!10988)
- Nested contract creation correctly limit gas according to EIP-150. (!10352)

### Breaking changes

### Internal

- Add a debug feature flag to the log crate for optional debug traces. (!10692)
