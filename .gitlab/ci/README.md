# CI guideline

This document describes the operating principles of the source code
around the CI.

# Job file names

 - If there is a single job file that contains the definition of a single GitLab CI
   job, then the file should have the same name as the job.  Example:
   the file `build/oc.build_kernels.yml` defines the job `oc.build_kernels`.
 - If there are multiple files that define a single job of the same
   name, then these files should be named `JOB_NAME-VARIANT.yml`.
   Example: the files `build/oc.docker:amd64-experimental.yml` and
   `build/oc.docker:amd64-release.yml` both define the job
   `oc.docker:amd64`.
 - If a job file defines several jobs sharing a common descriptive
   prefix, then the file should be named after that prefix. Example:
   the file `test/oc.unit.yml` define a set of jobs that share the
   prefix `oc.unit`.
 - If there is no such common prefix, or if it is not descriptive, an
   arbitrary but descriptive name can be used. Example: the file
   `test/install_octez.yml` defines a set of jobs where the shortest
   common name-prefix is the non-descriptive `oc.`, and so a more
   descriptive name `test/install_octez.yml` is used.

# Implementation of job `script`s

These rules also apply to `before_script` and `after_script`.

## Inline scripts

I.e., having the `script` in the YAML definition of the job. Inline
scripts MUST only be used for small job definitions (less than 5
lines) that do not use any control flow.

## Calling out to a script

`script` definitions longer than 5 lines of code OR that use
control-flow MUST be placed in a separate shell script.

## Organizing `before_script:` sections

A job's `before_script:` section should be used to:

 - take ownership of checkout with `scripts/ci/take_ownership.sh`
 - source `scripts/version.sh`
 - load opam environment with `eval $(opam env)`
 - load Python venv with `. $HOME/.venv/bin/activate`
 - install NPM dependencies with `. ./scripts/install_build_deps.js.sh`

For consistency, these actions (or a subset thereof) should be taken
in the order listed above.

## Simple form

Preference for simple form also applies to fields that can take either
a value of a certain type, or an array of such values. Examples
include the `cache:` field.

Do:

```
job_foo:
  script:
    - echo "I'm cached!"
  cache:
    paths:
      - foo.txt
```

Don't:

```
job_foo:
  script:
    - echo "I'm cached!"
  cache:
    - paths:
        - foo.txt
```
