# Linting via semgrep

This directory includes rules for linting.


## Usage

After [installing semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) simply
execute

```
semgrep -l ocaml -c linting/ --exclude "src/proto_0*/lib_protocol/*.ml*" src/
```

## Rules

Some rules are from the
[community standard library of rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules/).

Others developped in house.
