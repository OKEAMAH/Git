# Linting via semgrep

This directory includes rules for linting.


## Usage

After [installing semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/docs/getting-started/) simply
execute

```
make check-ocaml-linting
```

This command will analyse all the relevant files and will purposefully ignore
files such as already hashed protocols.

Alternatively, if you want to test only the library you are currently working
on, say, `src/lib_validation`, you can execute

```
semgrep --disable-metrics -l ocaml -c linting/ src/lib_validation/
```

## Rules

This directory contains our own in-house rules.
