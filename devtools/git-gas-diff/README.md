# `git-gas-diff`

`git-gas-diff` is a tool that makes a synthesis of gas changes from a git diff on regression traces.

## Build and run

Compile with `make`.

Run with `dune exec git-gas-diff [file]`. [file] is optional; if absent, the standard input will be read.

Typical usage is to pipe a `git diff` with the tool:
```
git diff HEAD^ HEAD | dune exec git-gas-diff
```
if the top commit is an update of the gas for regression traces.

See `bin/main.ml` for more details.

## Wrapper

`git-gas-diff.sh` is a wrapper script that simplifies the typical usage of invoking
```
git diff [commit1] [commit2] | dune exec git-gas-diff
```
by simply running `./git-gas-diff.sh [commit1] [commit2]`. It sets a few options to reduce the size of the embedded `git diff`, and can also be called with a single commit argument that will be then compared to `HEAD`.

See `git-gas-diff.sh` for more details.

## Example

(When run on a clone of https://gitlab.com/nomadic-labs/tezos/-/tree/master.)

```
$ ./git-gas-diff.sh 4a6c91ee 1a28a48ed2c9fa654ed7d601302d551332b52e77
