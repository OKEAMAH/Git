Breaking Changes

RPC Changes
-----------

- The new ``current_voting_power`` RPC computes the voting power of a
  delegate based on its current stake (as opposed to reading it from
  the vote listings as the ``voting_power`` does) (MR :gl:`!9329`)

Operation receipts

Minor Changes

- Rename ``endorsement`` into ``attestation`` in protocol errors (MR :gl:`!9192`)
