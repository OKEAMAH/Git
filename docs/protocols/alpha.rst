Protocol Alpha
==============

This page contains all the relevant information for protocol Alpha
(see :ref:`naming_convention`).

The code can be found in the :src:`src/proto_alpha` directory of the
``master`` branch of Tezos.

This page documents the changes brought by protocol Alpha with respect
to Protocol I.

.. contents::

New Environment Version (V5)
----------------------------

This protocol requires a different protocol environment than Ithaca.
It requires protocol environment V5, compared to V4 for Ithaca.
(MR :gl:`!4071`)

Transaction Optimistic Rollups
------------------------------

- Feature flag & origination. (MR :gl:`!3915`)

Tickets Hardening
-----------------

- Tickets lazy storage diff. (MR :gl:`!4011`)

Smart Contract Optimistic Rollups
---------------------------------

- Add smart-contract rollup creation. (MR :gl:`!3941`)

- Add a smart contract rollup node. (MR :gl:`!4000`)

- Add Inbox. (MR :gl:`!4020`)

Voting procedure
----------------

The voting power of a delegate is no longer rounded to rolls, it is
now instead the full staking power of the delegate, currently
expressed in mutez.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- The binary encoding of the result of the ``Transaction`` operation
  has changed.  Its contents now vary depending on the kind of
  destination. The default cases (implicit and smart contracts) are
  prefixed with the tag ``0``.

- The `consumed_gas` field in the encoding of operations becomes
  **deprecated** in favour of `consumed_milligas`, which contains
  a more precise readout for the same value. `consumed_milligas`
  field was added to the encoding of block metadata for uniformity.
  (MR :gl:`!4388`)

- The following RPCs output format changed:

  1. ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/votes/proposals``,
  2. ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/votes/ballots``,
  3. ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/votes/listings``,
  4. ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/votes/total_voting_power``,
  5. ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/context/delegates/<public_key_hash>``
  6. ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/context/delegates/<public_key_hash>/voting_power``

  The voting power that was represented by ``int32`` (denoting rolls)
  is now represented by an ``int64`` (denoting mutez). Furthermore, in
  the RPC ``/chains/<chain_id>/blocks/<block>/votes/listings``, the
  field ``rolls`` has been replaced by the field ``voting_power``.

- Encoding of transaction and origination operations no longer contains
  deprecated `big_map_diff` field. `lazy_storage_diff` should be used
  instead. (MR: :gl:`!4387`)

Bug Fixes
---------

- Expose `consumed_milligas` in the receipt of the `Register_global_constant`
  operation. (MR :gl:`!3981`)

- Refuse operations with inconsistent counters. (MR :gl:`!4024`)

20s Block Times (MR :gl:`!4163`)
--------------------------------

Blocks times have been reduced from 30 seconds to 20 seconds.
That is, a block can be produced with a delay of 20 seconds with respect to the previous block, if both blocks have round 0.
This change comes with updating many related protocol parameters in order to match the reduced block times.
In particular, the following quantities are kept the same:

- the minimal time period of a cycle (namely, 2 days, 20 hours, and 16 minutes),
- the minimal time period of a voting period (namely, 14 days, 5 hours, and 20 minutes),
- the number of nonce commitments per cycle (namely, 128),
- the number of stake snapshots per cycle (namely, 16),
- the maximum rewards per minute (namely 80 tez), and therefore roughly the same inflation,
- the minimal "time to live" of an operation (namely, 1 hour),
- the block gas limit per minute (namely 10400000 gas),
- the ratio between the liquidity baking subsidy and the maximum rewards per block (namely, 1/16).

Finally, the update to the LB sunset level is such that it is in line with the
previous update made in Ithaca (MR :gl:`!3911`), which set the sunset
level to 20 voting periods after the Ithaca's expected activation.

Minor Changes
-------------

- The RPC ``../context/delegates`` takes two additional Boolean flags
  ``with_minimal_stake`` and ``without_minimal_stake``, which allow to
  enumerate only the delegates that have at least a minimal stake to
  participate in consensus and in governance, or do not have such a
  minimal stake, respectively. (MR :gl:`!3951`)

- Make cache layout a parametric constant of the protocol. (MR :gl:`!4035`)

Michelson
---------

- Some operations are now forbidden in views: ``CREATE_CONTRACT``,
  ``SET_DELEGATE`` and ``TRANSFER_TOKENS`` cannot be used at the top-level of a
  view because they are stateful, and ``SELF`` because the entry-point does not
  make sense in a view.
  However, ``CREATE_CONTRACT``, ``SET_DELEGATE`` and ``TRANSFER_TOKENS`` remain
  available in lambdas defined inside a view.
  (MR :gl:`!3737`)

- Stack variable annotations are ignored and not propagated. All contracts that
  used to typecheck correctly before will still typecheck correctly afterwards.
  Though more contracts are accepted as branches with different stack variable
  annotations won't be rejected any more.
  The special annotation ``%@`` of ``PAIR`` has no effect.
  RPCs ``typecheck_code``, ``trace_code``, as well as typechecking errors
  reporting stack types, won't report stack annotations any more.
  In their output encodings, the objects containing the fields ``item`` and
  ``annot`` are replaced with the contents of the field ``item``.
  (MR :gl:`!4139`)

- Variable annotations in pairs are ignored and not propagated.
  (MR :gl:`!4140`)

- Type annotations are ignored and not propagated.
  (MR :gl:`!4141`)

- Field annotations are ignored and not propagated.
  (MR :gl:`!4175`, :gl:`!4311`, :gl:`!4259`)

- Annotating the parameter toplevel constructor to designate the root entrypoint
  is now forbidden. Put the annotation on the parameter type instead.
  E.g. replace ``parameter %a int;`` by ``parameter (int %a);``
  (MR :gl:`!4366`)

- The ``VOTING_POWER`` of a contract is no longer rounded to rolls. It
  is now instead the full staking power of the delegate, currently
  expressed in mutez. Though, developers should not rely on
  ``VOTING_POWER`` to query the staking power of a contract in
  ``mutez``: the value returned by ``VOTING_POWER`` is still of type`
  ``nat`` and it should only be considered relative to
  ``TOTAL_VOTING_POWER``.

- The new type ``tx_rollup_l2_address`` has been introduced. It is
  used to identify accounts on transaction rollupsâ€™ legders. Values of
  type ``tx_rollup_l2_address`` are 20-byte hashes of a BLS
  public keys (with a string notation based of a base58 encoding,
  prefixed with ``tru2``). (MR :gl:`!4431`)

- A new instruction ``MIN_BLOCK_TIME`` has been added. It can be used to
  push the current minimal time between blocks onto the stack. The value is
  obtained from the protocol's ``minimal_block_delay`` constant.
  (MR :gl:`!4471`)

Internal
--------

The following changes are not visible to the users but reflect
improvements of the codebase.

- ``BALANCE`` is now passed to the Michelson interpreter as a step constant
  instead of being read from the context each time this instruction is
  executed. (MR :gl:`!3871`)

- Separate ``origination_nonce`` into its own module. (MR :gl:`!3928`)

- Faster gas monad. (MR :gl:`!4034`)

- Simplify cache limits for sampler state. (MR :gl:`!4041`)

- Tenderbrute - bruteforce seeds to obtain desired delegate selections in tests.
  (MR :gl:`!3842`)

- Clean Script_typed_ir_size.mli. (MR :gl:`!4088`)

- Improvements on merge type error flag. (MR :gl:`!3696`)

- Make entrypoint type abstract. (MR :gl:`!3755`)

- Make ``Slot_repr.t`` abstract. (MR :gl:`!4128`)

- Fix injectivity of types. (MR :gl:`!3863`)

- Split ``Ticket_storage`` in two and extract ``Ticket_hash_repr``.
  (MR :gl:`!4190`)

- Carbonated map utility module. (MR :gl:`!3845`)

- Extend carbonated-map with a fold operation. (MR :gl:`!4156`)

- Other internal refactorings or documentation. (MRs :gl:`!4276`, `!4385`)
