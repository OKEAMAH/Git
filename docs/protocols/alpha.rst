Protocol Alpha
==============

This page documents the changes brought by protocol Alpha with respect
to Nairobi (see :ref:`naming_convention`).

The code can be found in directory :src:`src/proto_alpha` of the ``master``
branch of Octez.

.. contents::

Environment Version
-------------------

This protocol requires a different protocol environment version than Nairobi.
It requires protocol environment V10, compared to V9 for Nairobi.

Smart Rollups
-------------

- Add the support for bootstrapped smart rollups in storage initialization,
  similarly to bootstrapped accounts and smart contracts. (MR :gl:`!8552`)

- Remove the origination proof from the smart rollups’ origination operation.
  (MR :gl:`!8817`)

Zero Knowledge Rollups (ongoing)
--------------------------------

Data Availability Layer (ongoing)
---------------------------------

Adaptive Inflation (ongoing)
----------------------------

- Introduce feature flag for Adaptive Inflation. (MR :gl:`!8566`)

When the feature flag is enabled, the following extra changes happen:

- Most rewards (baking rewards, baking bonuses, attestation rewards, revelation
  rewards) are paid on the frozen deposits balance rather than the spendable
  balance. Manager operations fees and denunciation rewards are still paid on
  the spendable balance. (MR :gl:`!8091`)


Gas improvements
----------------

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Protocol parameter ``ratio_of_frozen_deposits_slashed_per_double_endorsement`` is
  converted from the ratio ``1/5`` into the percentage ``50%`` and renamed to
  ``percentage_of_frozen_deposits_slashed_per_double_endorsement``. (MR :gl:`!8753`)

- Protocol parameter ``double_baking_punishment`` is converted from a fixed
  value of ``640tz`` into the percentage ``11%`` and renamed to
  ``percentage_of_frozen_deposits_slashed_per_double_baking``. (MR :gl:`!8753`)


RPC Changes
-----------

- Split duplicated argument ``pkh`` in RPC ``smart_rollups/smart_rollup/<address>/staker1/<pkh>/staker2/<pkh>/timeout``
  and ``smart_rollups/smart_rollup/<address>/staker1/<pkh>/staker2/<pkh>/timeout_reached`` into ``/staker1/<staker1_pkh>/staker2/<staker2_pkh>``.
  This changes the RPC description but not its use. (MR :gl:`!8339`)

- Update context with new reward parameters. This changes the JSON from the RPC
  ``/chains/main/blocks/head/context/constants``. (MR :gl:`!8657`)


- Remove the RPC for computing smart rollups’ origination proofs
  ``smart_rollups/all/origination_proof``. (MR :gl:`!8817`)

Operation receipts
------------------

Bug Fixes
---------

Minor Changes
-------------

Internal
--------

- Fail earlier when a smart rollup commitment is in conflict when cementing.
  (MR :gl:`!8128`)

- split smart rollup origination fct for readibility. (MR :gl:`!8276`)

- Remove the deprecated and unused ``tx_rollup_l2_address`` Michelson
  type. (MR :gl:`!8546`)

- Add an internal represention case for the ``UNIT`` Michelson instruction. (MR :gl:`!8579`)

- Encoding that supports ``endorsement`` kind in JSON are now suffixed with
  ``_with_legacy_attestation_name``. Non legacy encoding supports
  ``attestation`` kind. (MRs :gl:`!8563`, :gl:`!8531`)

- Michelson: remove legacy behaviour related to contract type. (MR :gl:`!5800`)

- Michelson: cleanup legacy annotation management. (MR :gl:`!8208`)

- Michelson: refactor management of metadata in ty smart constructors. (MR :gl:`!8420`)

- Michelson: remove unused deprecated tx_rollup_l2_address type. (MR :gl:`!8546`)

- Rename ``source`` into ``sender``. (MR :gl:`!7373`)

- Improve efficiency of solving the baker PoW challenge. (MR :gl:`!8403`)

- Refactor declarations of ``make_empty_context`` and ``make_empty_tree`` for easier use.
  (MR :gl:`!8550`)

- Move notions of Smart rollup address and various smart rollup hashes types to
  the shell to make them common to all protocols though the environment. (MR
  :gl:`!8562`, MR :gl:`!8625`)

- Refactoring : stake splitted between a frozen part and a delegated part. (MR :gl:`!8051`)

- Refactoring : rewards computed as a relative portion of the total amount of tez
  rewarded per minute (about 85tez/min). (MR :gl:`!8657`)

- Introduce the notion of rollups “machine” which can compute the semantics of
  a given rollup, but cannot be used to generate or verify proof. (MR
  :gl:`!8815`)

- Consensus: optimized validation of attestations by maintaining a set
  of forbidden delegates instead of checking through an I/O that the
  delegate has a sufficient frozen deposit. (MR :gl:`!8722`)

- Store a history of percentages of slashed deposits. (MR :gl:`!8828`)

- Renaming the ``endorsement_power`` and ``preendorsement_power`` fields from
  consensus operation receipt to ``consensus_power`` in the non legacy encoding.
  (MR :gl:`!8531`)
