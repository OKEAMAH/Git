Setting up the client
======================

A client in the Tezos network provides different configuration possibilities:

- tune various parameters of the client using flexible combinations of: a configuration file, command-line options, and environment variables
- configure how keys are managed, with different security tradeoffs
- select different running modes, beside the default mode, which are intended to facilitate testing applications on smaller or fake networks: for example by executing some RPCs locally, without sending requests to a Tezos node.

These configuration possibilities are described in the following pages.
