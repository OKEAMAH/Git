  (* To test that adaptive issuance is active, we test that
     staking, a feature only available after the activation, is

     explicitely set a positive limit_of_staking_over_baking to allow
     them. Setting this limit does not immediately take effect but can
     be done before the activation. For these reasons, we set it at
     the beginning.

     The baking_over_staking_edge indicates the portion of the rewards
     sent to the delegate's liquid balance. It's expressed in
     billionth, with 0 meaning that everything is frozen and one
     billion meaning that everything is liquid. We send all rewards to
