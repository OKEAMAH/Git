     The case for protocol migrations when the lag constant has

     Suppose that a slot header is published at the second last level of a
     cycle, and the lag is 2. The block is expected to be confirmed at the
     first level of the new cycle. However, if during the protocol migration
     we reduce the lag to 1, then the slots header will never be confirmed.
