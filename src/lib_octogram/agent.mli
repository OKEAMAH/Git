(** This module introduces the business logic run by an Octogram agent on a
    remote runner. *)

type request = {
  proc_id : int;
  procedure : Uri.agent_uri Remote_procedure.packed;
}

(** [run ~input ~output state] changes the current working directory of the
    process to the [state]â€™s home directory (see {!initial_state}), starts an
    event loop, reading request from [input] and writing the results to
    [output].

    For a request [{proc_id; procedure}], the expected encoding to be read from
    the standard input is the Json encoding specified by {!request_encoding}.
    
    The agent responds with the [<<[{proc_id}] :] (that is, if [proc_id] is
    equal to 1, the magic string is [<<[1]: ], followed by a Json response as
    specified by the encodings defined in the {!Remote_procedure} module).*)
