(** This file defines the services of the rollup node that do not depend on the
    protocol. A top-level directory is built for them in the rollup node
    library.

    Protocol specific services are for RPCs under [/global/block/] and are
    defined in the protocol specific libraries in
    [protocols/proto_*/lib_sc_rollup_layer2/sc_rollup_services.ml].
*)

(** We distinguish RPC endpoints served by the rollup node into [global] and
    [local]. The difference between the two lies in whether the responses given
    by different rollup nodes in the same state (see below for an exact
    definition) must be the same (in the case of global endpoints) or can differ
    (in the case of local endpoints).

    More formally, two rollup nodes are in the same quiescent state if they are
    subscribed to the same rollup address, and have processed the same set of
    heads from the layer1. We only consider quiescent states, that is those
    where rollup nodes are not actively processing a head received from layer1.

    Examples of global endpoints are [current_tezos_head] and
    [last_stored_commitment], as the responses returned by these endpoints is
    expected to be consistent across rollup nodes in the same state.

    An example of local endpoint is [last_published_commitment], as two rollup
    nodes in the same state may either publish or not publish a commitment,
    according to whether its inbox level is below the inbox level of the last
    cemented commitment at the time they tried to publish the commitment.  See
    below for a more detailed explanation.
