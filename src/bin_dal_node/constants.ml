     cache. Each entry in the cache maintains two open file descriptors (one via
     regular file opening and one via mmap on the bitset region). Note that setting
     a too high value causes a "Too many open files" error. *)

let committee_cache_size = 50

(* The size of the cache of 1024 entries (one per slot) is chosen such
   that: if a DAL node stores the shard proofs of 128 slots per level,
   the cache will be able to store the proofs for 8 levels, which
   should be quite sufficient with the current attestation lag.

   A shard proof takes 52 bytes with the current encoding (could be improved
   to 48), so the maximum memory footprint of the cache is dominated by (keys
   size is negligible):

   1024 (cache size) * 2048 (shards per slot) * 52 bytes = 109 mb *)
