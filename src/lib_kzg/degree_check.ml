(* p(X) of degree n. Max degree that can be committed: d, which is also the
   SRS's length - 1. We take d = t.max_polynomial_length - 1 since we don't want to commit
   polynomials with degree greater than polynomials to be erasure-encoded.

   We consider the bilinear groups (G_1, G_2, G_T) with G_1=<g> and G_2=<h>.
   - Commit (p X^{d-n}) such that deg (p X^{d-n}) = d the max degree
   that can be committed
   - Verify: checks if e(commit(p), commit(X^{d-n})) = e(commit(p X^{d-n}), h)
   using the commitments for p and p X^{d-n}, and computing the commitment for
   X^{d-n} on G_2. *)
