## Version fc06d63568b1be253088ff5d6e422fd80ed3d2c2

### EVM Kernel

- Fallback mechanism if stage zero fails. (!9732)
- Switch to `ExternalMessageFrame` protocol for external messages. (!9687)

- The kernel can no longer be administrated by a L2 dictator key, instead by a
  L1 smart contract. It will consider upgrades messages coming from a specific
  address defined in its storage. (!9927)
- Adds a new type of message in simulation mode, to verify that a transaction is valid by checking if the nonce is neither too low nor too high. (!9679)
- Simulate if a transaction has a correct chain id. (!9752)
- Fees are now paid by the sender. (!9480)
- Unused gas is refunded after succesful transactions. (!9915)
- Impose a maximum gas limit per transaction based on the tick model. (!10094)
- Transaction logs and bloom filter are returned in a transaction receipt. (!10019)
- Support EIP-3607: reject transactions from senders with deployed code. (!10292)

### EVM Node

- Switch to `ExternalMessageFrame` protocol for external messages. (!9687)

  to the one on development. (!9940)
- `eth_sendRawTransaction` checks that the nonce of the transaction is neither too low nor too high. (!9679)
- `eth_sendRawTransaction` checks if the chain id is correct. (!9752)
- Use different files to store kernel logs, differenciate the different kind of
  simulations. (!9664)
- Add support for `eth_getBlockByHash`. (!10061)
- Add support for `eth_getTransactionByBlockHashAndIndex` and `eth_getTransactionByBlockNumberAndIndex`. (!10068)

  returning them. (!10116)

- Add support for `eth_getStorageAt`. (!10214)

### Bug fixes

### Breaking changes

- External Messages must now be framed using `ExternalMessageFrame` (adds an additional prefix byte). (!9687)
- The EVM rollup accepts tickets wrapping tez instead of ctez. (!9982)
- L2 blocks are now stored using their RLP encoding. (!9759)

- Add withdrawals to the transaction stack in the EVM handler. (!9905)
- Make it possible for any precompiled contract to generate withdrawals. (!9910)
- Nested transactions give unused gas back to parent transaction after completion. (!9877)
- Make it possible for any precompiled contract to generate withdrawals. (!9910)
- A precompiled contract for withdrawing funds at address 0x00...20. (!10022)

## Version 4c111dcae061bea6c3616429a0ea1262ce6c174f

### EVM Kernel

- Kernel has an internal version. (!9579)
- Improve kernel's logging from the rollup node's perspective. (!9571)

  panic. (!9654)
