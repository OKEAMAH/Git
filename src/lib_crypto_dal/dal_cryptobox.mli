(** Because of the shell/protocol separation, cryptographic primitives
   need to be splitted. An interface, called the {!module:Verifier}
   aims to be provided for the economic protocol. The other interface,
   called the {!module:Builder} is for the shell.

    A [Verifier], has hinted by the name, mainly needs to check
   proofs:

    1. A proof that a commitment is valid

    2. A proof that a segment is valid

   A technicality is that the economic protocol is able to configure
   those cryptographic primitives via several constants.  Also, an SRS
   (aka trusted setup) is required.

   It is the responsibility of the shell and the protocol to ensure
   that both the [Verifier] and the [Builder] as instantiated with the
   same parameters and use the same trusted setup. *)

(** A polynomial is another representation for a slot. One advantage

      1. A commitment ensures that the size of the [slot] has a
     bounded size (typically [slot_size]).

      2. A commitment can be used to verify that a segment of fixed size
      (typically [segment_size]) is part of the original slot. *)
