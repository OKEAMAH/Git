           picture it as two successive steps:

           1. a serialization phase where pages are converted to sequences
           of scalar elements, which is injective: if two outputs for two

           splitting a page into chunks of [scalar_bytes_amount] bytes and
           a last one of [t.remaining_bytes] bytes.

           Parse the byte sequence slot = page_0 ... page_{t.pages_per_slot-1}
           page by page by chunks of [scalar_bytes_amount], or [t.remaining_bytes]
           for the last page chunk.

           to obtain the vector of length [k = t.page_length * t.pages_per_slot]

           p_0^{t.pages_per_slot-1} ... p_{page_length-1}^{t.pages_per_slot-1}]

           2. then apply the permutation, reindexing the page elements so
           that their indices correspond to the appropriate coset.

           [ p_0^0 p_0^1 ... p_0^{t.pages_per_slot-1}

         and W_i = w^i W_0 (|W_0|=t.shard_length).

         For a set of [t.k / shard_length] shard indices
         Z subseteq {0, t.number_of_shards-1}, we reorganize the product
         A(x)=prod_{i=0}^{k-1} (x-x_i) into

         A(x) = prod_{i in Z, |Z|=t.k/t.shard_length} Z_i
         where Z_i = prod_{w' in W_i} (x - w').

         We notice that Z_0(x)=x^{|W_0|}-1 (as its roots
         are the elements of a group of order dividing |W_0|)
         entails Z_i(x)=x^{|W_0|}-w^{i*|W_0|}
         (multiplying all terms by a constant w^i in an
         integral domain), which is a sparse polynomial.
         This special form for Z_i(x) allows us to compute the product of
         the Z_i(x)s more efficiently with the [mul_xn] function, which
         multiplies an arbitrary polynomial P with a polynomial of the
         form Z_i(x) in time linear in (degree P + degree Z_i(x)).

         Thus A(x) = prod_{i in Z, |Z|=k/l} x^{|W_0|}-w^{i*|W_0|}.

         More formally: every element of W_i is of the form
         w^i w^{t.number_of_shards j} for j in ⟦0, t.shard_length-1⟧. Thus

         Z_i(w^i w^{s j}) = (w^i w^{s j})^{|W_0|}-w^{i*|W_0|}
                          = (w^i)^{|W_0|} (w^{s j})^{|W_0|} - w^{i*|W_0|}
                          = w^{i * |W_0|} * 1 - w^{i*|W_0|}=0.

         So every element of W_i is a root of Z_i(x).
         Moreover, Z_i(x) is a degree |W_0|=t.shard_length polynomial
         so has at most [t.shard_length] roots:
