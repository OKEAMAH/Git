    exported by this module. A value of type [t] contains both initial

type t

(** Because of the shell/protocol separation, cryptographic primitives
   need to be splitted. An interface, called the {!module:Verifier}
   aims to be provided for the economic protocol. The other interface,
   called the [Builder] is for the shell.

    A [Verifier], as hinted by the name, mainly needs to check
   proofs:

    1. A proof that a commitment is valid

    2. A proof that a page is valid

   A technicality is that the economic protocol is able to configure
   those cryptographic primitives via several constants.  Also, an SRS
   (aka trusted setup) is required.

   It is the responsibility of the shell and the protocol to ensure
   that both the [Verifier] and the [Builder] are instantiated with the
   same parameters and use the same trusted setup. *)

     bounded size (typically [slot_size]).

      2. A commitment can be used to verify that a page of fixed size
      (typically [page_size]) is part of the original slot. *)
