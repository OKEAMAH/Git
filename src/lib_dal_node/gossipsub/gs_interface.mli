(** This module defines the relevant data structures to instantiate the
    gossipsub worker. *)

(** A topic is defined by a public key hash of an attestor and a slot index.
    - A slot producer tracks the topic associated to a given slot index for all
    the public key-hashes;
    - The attestor tracks its own public key hash for all the slot indices;
    - A slot consumer tracks topics associated to a given slot index and enough
    public key-hashes so that the number of covered shards is enough to recover
    the slot data. *)
type topic = {slot_index : int; pkh : Signature.Public_key_hash.t}

(** A message id uniquely identifies a share whose commitment is included in an
    L1 block. It is defined by a tuple containing the commitment, the level at
    which the commitment is successfully included in an L1 block, the
    corresponding slot index, the shard index, as well as the public key hash
    [pkh] of the delegate expected to attest it.

    Note that [pkh] is used to be able to directly infer a topic from a message id. It
    could be retrieved from L1 using the level. But, we decide to provide it
    directly in this first version. *)
type message_id = {
  commitment : Cryptobox.Commitment.t;
  level : int32;
  slot_index : int;
  shard_index : int;
  pkh : Signature.Public_key_hash.t;
}

(** A message is a portion of an encoded slot's data. It's basically a shard
    without the corresponding index. The proof that the corresponding shard
    belong to the commitment (part of the message id) is also part of the
    message. *)
type message = {share : Cryptobox.share; shard_proof : Cryptobox.shard_proof}

(** From the Gossipsub point of view, a peer is given by a cryptographic node
    identity {!P2p_peer.Id.t}. It's up to the caller to associate the
    {!P2p_peer.Id.t} to a {!P2p_point.Id.t} if needed (to e.g. implement peers
    exchange, which needs addresses and ports instead of cryptographic
    identities). *)
