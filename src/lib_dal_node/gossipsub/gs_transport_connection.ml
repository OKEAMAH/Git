    Note that, a connection is considered [outbound] only if we initiated it and

    are not considered outgoing connections by default, as they are not trusted
    unless explicitly specified otherwise.

    Indeed, Gossipsub tries to maintain a threshold of outbound connections per
    topic. So, we don't automatically set connections we initiate to PX peers as
    outbound to avoid possible love bombing attacks. The Rust version also
    implements a way to mitigate this risk, but not the Go implementation.

         We may have an issues as described by the following scenario:
         - A legit pair [(point, peer)] is already known by P2P, but the remote
         peer is disconnected for some reason;
         - Some (malicious) peer advertises a fake px [(point, peer')], where
         [peer'] is not the real peer id associated to the [point];
         - We try to connect to [point], setting at the same time that [peer']
         is the expected peer id for this point;
         - The connection fails, but the old (correct) association [(point,
         peer)] is lost.

         We may want to revert [peer'] association to [point]. But we sill have
         an issue in case [(point, peer)] is actually the fake info and [(point,
         peer')] the legit association but the node is disconnected when trying
         to connect to it.

         This implementation will be hardened once we add the notion of "signed
