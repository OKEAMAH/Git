(** {2 Validation of voting operations}

    There are two kinds of voting operations:

    - Proposals: A delegate submits a list of protocol amendment
      proposals. This operation is only accepted during a Proposal period
      (see above).

    - Ballot: A delegate casts a vote for/against the current proposal
      (or pass). This operation is only accepted during an Exploration
      or Promotion period (see above). *)
