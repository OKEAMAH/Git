(** Encoding of DAC payload as a Merkle tree with an arbitrary branching
    factor greater or equal to 2. The serialization process works as follows:
    {ul
      {li A large sequence of bytes, the payload, is split into several pages
          of fixed size, each of which is prefixed with a small sequence
          of bytes (also of fixed size), which is referred to as the preamble
          of the page. Pages obtained directly from the original payload
          are referred to as `Contents pages`. Contents pages constitute the
          leaves of the Merkle tree being built,
      }
      {li Each contents page (each of which is a sequence of bytes consisting
        of the preamble followed by the actual contents from the original
        payload) is then hashed. The size of each hash is fixed. The hashes are
        concatenated together, and the resulting sequence of bytes is split
        into pages of the same size of `Hashes pages`, each of which is
        prefixed with a preamble whose size is the same as in Contents pages.
        Hashes pages correspond to nodes of the Merkle tree being built, and
        the children of a hash page are the (either Payload or Hashes) pages
        whose hash appear into the former,
      }
      {li Hashes pages are hashed using the same process described above, leading
        to a smaller list of hashes pages. To guarantee that the list of hashes
        pages is actually smaller than the original list of pages being hashed,
        we require the size of pages to be large enough to contain at least two
        hashes.

    Merkle tree encodings of DAC pages are versioned, to allow for multiple
    hashing schemes to be used.
