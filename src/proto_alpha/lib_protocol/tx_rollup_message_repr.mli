(** Communication from the layer-1 (Tezos) to the layer-2 (a
    transaction rollup) happens thanks to messages, crafted in the
    layer-1 to be interpreted in the layer-2.

    Messages are constructed and gathered in the layer-1, in
    inboxes. *)

    transaction rollup, for the benefit of a {!Tx_rollup_l2_address.t}. *)

(** A [message] is a piece of data originated from the layer-1 to be
    interpreted by the layer-2.

    Transaction rollups feature two kind of messages:

    {ul {li An array of bytes that supposedly contains a valid
            sequence of layer-2 operations; their interpretation and
            validation is deferred to the layer-2..}
        {li A deposit order for a L1 ticket.}} *)

    inbox by [msg]. *)

val encoding : t Data_encoding.t

(** The Blake2B hash of a message.

    To avoid unnecessary storage duplication, the inboxes in the
    layer-1 do not contain the messages, but their hashes. This is
    possible because the content of the messages can be reconstructed
    off-chain by looking at the layer-1 operations and their
    receipt. *)
