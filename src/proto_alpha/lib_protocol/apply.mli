      (** This mode is mainly intended to be used by a mempool, in which

          might use it with [None]. *)

(** Apply an operation, i.e. update the given context in accordance
    with the operation's semantic (or return an error if the operation
    is not applicable).

    The {!type:Validate_operation.stamp} argument enforces that an
    operation needs to be validated by {!Validate_operation} before it
    can be applied.

    For non-manager operations, the application of a validated
    operation should always fully succeed.

    For manager operations, the application has two stages. The first
    stage consists in updating the context to:

    - take the fees;

    - increment the account's counter;

    - decrease of the available block gas by operation's [gas_limit].

    These updates are mandatory. In particular, taking the fees is
    critically important. The {!Validate_operation} module (from which
    we get the {!Validate_opoeration.stamp} as explained above) is
    responsible for ensuring that the operation is solvable, i.e. that
    fees can be taken, i.e. that the first stage of manager operation
    application cannot fail. If this stage fails nevertheless, the
    function returns an error.

    The second stage of this function (still in the case of a manager
    operation) consists in applying all the other effects, in
    accordance with the semantic of the operation's kind.

    An error may happen during this second phase: in that case, the
    function returns the context obtained at the end of the first
    stage, and metadata that contain the error. This means that the
    operation has no other effects than those described above during
    the first phase. *)
