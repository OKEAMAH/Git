(** [update_burn_per_byte state ~final_size ~hard_limit] updates the

    inbox, based on the ratio of the [hard_limit] maximum amount of
    byte an inbox can use and the [final_size] amount of bytes it uses
    at the end of the construction of a Tezos block.

    In a nutshell, if the ratio is lesser than 80%, the burn per byte
    are reduced. If the ratio is somewhere between 80% and 90%, the
    burn per byte remain constant. If the ratio is greater than 90%,
    then the burn per byte are increased.

    The rationale behind this mechanics is to reduce the activity of a
    transaction rollup in case it becomes too intense. *)
