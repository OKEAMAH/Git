(** [load_reward_coeff ctxt] loads the current cycle's reward coeff from the
    storage into the context *)
val load_reward_coeff : Raw_context.t -> Raw_context.t tzresult Lwt.t

(** [update_stored_rewards_at_cycle_end ctxt ~new_cycle] updates
    {!Storage.Reward_coeff} with a new coefficient that will be applied
    [preserved_cycles] cycles after the given [new_cycle]. This new coefficient
    depends on the current {!Storage.Total_supply}, and the total active stake
    for when this coefficient is computed.

    This function also removes obsolete values from {!Storage.Reward_coeff},
    and stores the current cycle's coefficient in the context for faster
    access. *)

(** [activate ctxt ~cycle] adds into the context the cycle at which
    the adaptive inflation feature gets activated. If this function is
    never called, then the context does not contain the cycle for the
    feature activation, which implies the feature is inactive.

    In practice, it means that you may call
    [Storage.Adaptive_inflation.Activation.find ctxt] to get the value
    of the cycle at which the feature is activated, and if that call
    returns [None], then it means the feature has not been
    voted to be activated (yet). *)
