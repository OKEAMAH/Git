(** The state of a transaction rollup is composed of [burn_per_byte]
    and [inbox_ema] fields. [initial_state] introduces their initial
    values. Both values are updated by [update_burn_per_byte] as the
    rollup progresses.

    [burn_per_byte] state the cost of burn per byte to be paid for
    each byte submitted to a transaction rollup inbox. [inbox_ema]
    is a key factor to impact the update of [burn_per_byte].

    [inbox_ema] is the N-block EMA to react to recent N-inbox size
    changes. N-block EMA is an exponential moving average (EMA), that
    is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and
    significance on the most N data points. The purpose of [inbox_ema]
    is to get lessened volatility of burn, that is more resistant to
    spurious spikes of [burn_per_byte].

   The state of the transaction rollup also keeps track of four pointers
   to four different rollup levels.

    - The [commitment_tail_level] is the level of the oldest
      finalized commitment still stored in the layer-1 storage.

    - The [commitment_head_level] is the level of the most recent
      unfinalized commitment in the layer-1 storage.

    - The [oldest_inbox_level] is the level of the oldest inbox still stored
      in the layer-1 storage.

    - The [head_level] is the level of the most recent inbox in the
      layer-1 storage.

   The main use of a transaction rollup state is to keep track of four
   pointers to four different rollup levels (see above).

   When the rollup is created, these four pointers are initialized with
   the [None] value, because no inboxes or commitments have been created
   yet. Because inboxes and commitments can be removed from the layer-1
   context under certain circumstances, they can be reset to [None].

   Given [CT] the commitment tail, [OI] the oldest inbox, [CH] the
   commitment head, and [H] the head, a typical rollup state is

     finalized     uncommitted
       ^^^^^^        ^^^^^^^^
      CT           CH
       [------------]            commitments
             [--------------]    inboxes
            OI              H
             ^^^^^^^^
            unfinalized

   Note that the oldest inbox level is not always lesser than the
   commitment head. If the commitment head is equal to [None], it
   means all the inboxes currently stored in layer-1 are “uncommitted”, 
   that is, no commitments have been submitted for them.

   In such a case, the rollup state is analoguous to

     finalized
       ^^^^^^
      CT
       [-----[                   commitments
             [--------------]    inboxes
            OI              H
             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                uncommitted

   Similarly, it is possible to see the oldest inbox level and head level 
   set to [None]. For instance, when each commitment in the
   layer-1 storage has been properly finalized. In this case, the
   layout will be

     finalized
       ^^^^^^
      CT
       [-----[              commitments
             [              inboxes


   When a pointer is reset to [None], its next value will be decided
   by its previous value. For instance, when the oldest inbox level is
   set from [Some l] to [None], its next value is the successor level
   of [l].

   To implement this behavior, this module relies on four fields and
   four functions which share the same name. Once set to a given
   value, the fields are never set back to [None]. It is the purpose
   of the functions to determine if a value is correct, or kept in
   memory for future use, and only the functions are exposed to other
   modules.

   Let’s take the [oldest_inbox_level], for instance. It is supposed
   to be [None] iff there is no “uncommitted” inbox in the context,
   and we can retreive the number of uncommitted inbox by computing
   the difference between the fields [head_level] and
   [oldest_inbox_level].
