(** An inbox gathers, for a given Tezos level, messages crafted by the
    layer-1 for the layer-2 to interpret.

    The structure comprises two fields: (1) [contents] is the list of
    message hashes, and (2) [cumulated_size] is the quantity of bytes
    allocated by the related messages.

    We recall that a transaction rollup can have up to one inbox per
    Tezos level, starting from its origination. See
    {!Storage.Tx_rollup} for more information. *)
