      gas limit, and relative to the byte size)
    - clock drift for the prefiltering of consensus operations

    and for the {!conflict_handler}:

      ratios, in order to replace an old conflicting manager operation. *)

(** Perform some preliminary checks on an operation.

    For manager operations, check that its fee, fee/gas ratio, and
    fee/size ratio all meet the minimal requirements specified in the
    {!config}.

    For consensus operations, check that it is possible for the
    operation to have been produced before now (plus additional time
    equal to the [clock_drift] from {!config}, as a safety margin).
    Indeed, without this check, a baker could flood the network with
    consensus operations for any future rounds or levels. The ml file
    contains more detailled explanations with diagrams. *)
