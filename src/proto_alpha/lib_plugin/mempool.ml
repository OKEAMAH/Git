(** {2 consensus operation filtering}

     In Tenderbake, we increased a lot the number of consensus
      operations, therefore it seems necessary to be able to filter consensus
     operations that could be produced by a Byzantine baker mis-using
     its right to produce operations in future rounds or levels.

      We consider the situation where the head is at level [h_l],
     round [h_r], and with timestamp [h_ts], with the predecessor of the head
     being at round [hp_r].
      We receive at a time [now] a consensus operation for level [op_l] and
     round [op_r].

       A consensus operation is considered too far in the future, and therefore filtered,
      if the earliest possible starting time of its round is greater than the
      current time plus a safety margin of [config.clock_drift].

      To consider potential level 2 reorgs, we first compute the expected
      timestamp of round zero at previous level [hp0_ts],

      All ops at level p_l and round r' such that time(r') is greater than (now + drift) are
     deemed too far in the future:

                  h_r                          op_ts    now+drift     (h_l,r')
     hp0_ts h_0   h_l                            |        |              |
        +----+-----+---------+-------------------+--+-----+--------------+-----------
             |     |         |                   |  |     |              |
             |    h_ts     h_r end time          | now    |        earliest expected
             |     |                             |        |        time of round r'
             |<----op_r rounds duration -------->|        |
                   |
                   |<--------------- operations kept ---->|<-rejected----------...
                   |
                   |<-----------operations considered by the filter -----------...

    For an operation on a proposal at the next level, we consider the minimum
    starting time of the operation's round, obtained by assuming that the proposal
    at the next level was built on top of a proposal at round 0 for the current
    level, itself based on a proposal at round 0 of previous level.
    Operations on proposal with higher levels are treated similarly.

    All ops at the next level and round r' such that timestamp(r') > now+drift
    are deemed too far in the future.

                r=0     r=1   h_r      now     now+drift   (h_l+1,r')
   hp0_ts h_0   h_l           h_l       |          |          |
      +----+---- |-------+----+---------+----------+----------+----------

           |     t0      |   h_ts                      earliest expected
           |     |       |    |                         time of round r'
           |<--- |    earliest|                               |
                 |  next level|                               |
                 |       |<---------------------------------->|
                                  round_offset(r')

(** At a given level a consensus operation is acceptable if its earliest
      expected timestamp, [op_earliest_ts] is below the current clock with an
      accepted drift for the clock given by a configuration.  *)
let acceptable ~drift ~op_earliest_ts ~now_timestamp =
  Timestamp.(
    now_timestamp +? drift >|? fun now_drifted -> op_earliest_ts <= now_drifted)

(** Check that an operation with the given [op_round], at level [op_level]
      is likely to be correct, meaning it could have been produced before
      now (+ the safety margin from configuration).

      Given an operation at level greater or equal than/to the current level, we
      compute the expected timestamp of the operation's round. If the operation
      is at a greater level, we assume that it is based on the proposal at round
      zero of the current level.

      All operations whose (level, round) is lower than or equal to the current
      head are deemed valid.
      Note that in case where their is a high drift in the computer clock, they
      might not have been considered valid by comparing their expected timestamp
      to the clock.

      This is a stricter than necessary filter as it will reject operations that
      could be valid in the current timeframe if the proposal they endorse is
      built over a predecessor of the current proposal that would be of lower
      round than the current one.

      What can we do that would be smarter: get current head's predecessor round
      and timestamp to compute the timestamp t0 of a predecessor that would have
      been proposed at round 0.

      Timestamp of round at current level for an alternative head that would be
      based on such proposal would be computed based on t0.
      For level higher than current head, compute the round's earliest timestamp
      if all proposal passed at round 0 starting from t0.
