(** This error is returned when the requested data is not found. *)
type error += Missing_stored_kvs_data of string * int

(** {1 Key-value store}

    This module defines a simple key-value store. The design is
   minimal and aims to be:

    - easy to use

    - safe when used in a concurrent setting

    This key-value store also features a best effort mechanism relying
    on a cache to avoid I/Os.

    This key-value store assumes keys have a flat structure with a first
    layer of virtual directories and fixed-size virtual files in each directory.
    Each virtual directory is backed by a single physical file. Values are stored
    in virtual files, which are mapped sequentially in their virtual directory.  *)

(** An abstract representation of a key-value store. *)
type ('file, 'key, 'value) t

(** A [layout] specifies the layout of virtual files storing data of type ['value],
    as well as the name of the underlying physical file. *)
type ('key, 'value) layout

(** [layout ?encoded_value_size value_encoding path eq index_of] describes a layout.
    - [encoded_value_size] is the size in bytes of values encoded with [value_encoding].
      If [value_encoding] does not respect this property, the behaviour of the store
      is undefined. If [encoded_value_size] is not given, [value_encoding] must be of fixed length.
    - [value_encoding] is an encoding for the content of values
    - [path] is the path of the physical file
    - [eq] is an equality function on the values.
    - [index_of] gives the index of a given key in the file.

   @raise Invalid_argument if [encoded_value_size=None] and [value_encoding] does not have a fixed length.
 *)
val layout :
  ?encoded_value_size:int ->
  encoding:'value Data_encoding.t ->
  filepath:string ->
  eq:('value -> 'value -> bool) ->
  index_of:('key -> int) ->
  unit ->
  ('key, 'value) layout

(** [init ~lru_size layout] initialises a key-value store. This is a
    design where all keys/values are stored into a single physical
    file.

    For each file, we rely on a [layout] to explaining where to find
    the values. The layout also specify the physical location of the
    file.

    [lru_size] is a parameter that represents the number of different
   [values] that can be in memory. It is up to the user of this
   library to decide this number depending on the sizes of the values.
*)
val init :
  lru_size:int -> ('file -> ('key, 'value) layout) -> ('file, 'key, 'value) t

(** [close kvs] waits until all pending reads and writes are completed
    and closes the key-value store. *)
val close : ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> unit Lwt.t

(** [write_value ?(override=false) t key value] writes a value in the
   [key] value store. If a previous writing or read failed, the
   function will try again to write the value. If [override] is [true],
   the value will be written even though there is already a written
   value for this key.  *)
val write_value :
  ?override:bool ->
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  'file ->
  'key ->
  'value ->
  unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** [write_values ?(override=false) t seq] writes a sequence of [keys]
   [values] onto the store (see {!val:write_value}). If an error
   occurs, the first error is returned. This function guarantees that
   up to the data for which the error occured, the values where stored
   onto the disk. *)
val write_values :
  ?override:bool ->
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  ('file * 'key * 'value) Seq.t ->
  unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** [read_value t key] reads the value associated to [key] in the
   store. Fails if no value where attached to this [key]. The value
   read is the last one that was produced by a successful write. *)
val read_value :
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> 'file -> 'key -> 'value tzresult Lwt.t

(** [read_values t keys] produces a sequence of [values] associaed to
    the sequence of [keys]. This function is almost instantaneous
    since no reads are performed. Reads are done when the caller
    consumes the values of the sequence returned. *)
val read_values :
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  ('file * 'key) Seq.t ->
  ('file * 'key * 'value tzresult) Seq_s.t

(** Same as {!read_value} expect that this function returns whether the given
    entry exists without reading it. *)
val value_exists : ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> 'file -> 'key -> bool Lwt.t

(** Same as {!read_values} expect that this function returns whether the given
    entries exist without reading them. *)
