(** {1 Key-value store}

    This module defines a simple key-value store. The design is
   minimal and aims to be:

    - easy to use

    - safe when used in a concurrent setting

    This key-value store also features a best effort mechanism relying
    on an LRU (least-recently used) cache to avoid I/Os.

    Each key-value pair is associated to a virtual file. Each virtual file has a
    layout, given by the user, which specifies, among other things, an
    underlying physical file for storing the key-value pairs.  It is up to the
    user to decide which virtual file to use to store a key-value pair. It is
    recommended that values that will be accessed together frequently should be
    stored in the same file.

    In a virtual file, all the stored values should the same size. Each key is
    associated with an index from 0 to some maximum value (see
    implementation). Different keys should be associated to different
    indexes. *)

(** An abstract representation of a file-based key-value store. *)
type ('file, 'key, 'value) t

(** A [layout] specifies the layout of a virtual file storing keys of type
    ['key] and values of type ['value], as well as the path to the underlying
    physical file. *)
type ('key, 'value) layout

(** [layout ?encoded_value_size value_encoding path eq index_of] describes a
    virtual file layout.
    - [encoded_value_size] is the size in bytes of any encoded value.  If
    encoded values have different sizes, the behaviour of the store is
    undefined. If [encoded_value_size] is not given, then the encoded value size
    is deduced from [value_encoding], which must be of fixed length.
    - [value_encoding] is an encoding for values.
    - [path] is the path of the physical file.
    - [eq] is an equality function on values.
    - [index_of] gives the index of a given key.

   @raise Invalid_argument if [encoded_value_size=None] and [value_encoding] does not have a fixed length.
 *)

  ('key, 'value) layout

(** [init ~lru_size layout_of] initialises a file-based key-value
    store. [layout_of file] returns a {!type-layout} for a given virtual file
    [file]. All the keys/values associated to [file] are stored in a single
    physical file.

    [lru_size] is a parameter that represents the number of different
   values that can be in memory. It is up to the user of this
   library to decide this number depending on the sizes of the values.
*)
val init :
  lru_size:int -> ('file -> ('key, 'value) layout) -> ('file, 'key, 'value) t

(** [close kvs] waits until all pending reads and writes are completed
    and closes the key-value store. *)
val close : ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> unit Lwt.t

(** [write_value ?(override=false) t file key value] writes a value in
    the [key] value store in file [file]. If a previous writing or
    read failed, the function will try again to write the value. If
    [override] is [true], the value will be written even though there
    is already a written value for this key. *)
val write_value :
  ?override:bool ->
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  'file ->
  'key ->
  'value ->
  unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** [write_values ?(override=false) t seq] writes the sequence [seq]
    onto the store (see {!val:write_value}). If an error occurs, the
    first error is returned. This function guarantees that up to the
    data for which the error occured, the values where stored onto the
    disk. *)
val write_values :
  ?override:bool ->
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  ('file * 'key * 'value) Seq.t ->
  unit tzresult Lwt.t

(** [read_value t file key] reads the value associated to [key] in
    [file] in the store. Fails if no value were attached to this
    [key]. The value read is the last one that was produced by a
    successful write. *)
val read_value :
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> 'file -> 'key -> 'value tzresult Lwt.t

(** [read_values t keys] produces a sequence of [values] associated to
    the sequence of [keys]. This function is almost instantaneous
    since no reads are performed. Reads are done when the caller
    consumes the values of the sequence returned. *)
val read_values :
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  ('file * 'key) Seq.t ->
  ('file * 'key * 'value tzresult) Seq_s.t

(** Same as {!read_value} expect that this function returns whether the given
    entry exists without reading it. *)
val value_exists : ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> 'file -> 'key -> bool Lwt.t

(** Same as {!read_values} expect that this function returns whether the given
    entries exist without reading them. *)
val values_exist :
  ('file, 'key, 'value) t ->
  ('file * 'key) Seq.t ->
  ('file * 'key * bool) Seq_s.t

(** [remove_file t file] removes the corresponding physical file of
    [file] from the disk as well as the corresponding keys/values of
    the store. In case of concurrent read/write, this function should
    succeed no matter what. The result of [read/write] depends on
    which function was issued first. For example if the [read] was
    issued before the [remove_file], it will returns the corresponding
    value that was stored, and then the file will be removed. *)
val remove_file : ('file, 'key, 'value) t -> 'file -> unit Lwt.t
