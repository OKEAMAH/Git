(** Test tags with specific semantics. *)

(** The following values are string constants that can be added to [~tags]
    in [Test.register]. They have specific semantics that is documented here.
    By using [Tag.x] instead of ["x"] in [~tags], you allow developers
    to jump to the definition of [Tag.x] and thus see the documentation of the tag.
    You also avoid mistakes like using ["ci_disable"] instead of ["ci_disabled"]. *)

(** ["flaky"]: the test is flaky.

    This disables the test in the CI just like {!ci_disabled}.
    Contrary to {!ci_disabled} however, this also gives the reason why the test
    is disabled: the test is flaky.

    Tip: you can list tests that are declared as flaky with [tezt --list flaky].
    You can check if they are still flaky with something like
    [tezt flaky --loop-count 100].

    Since this tag already conveys information about why the test is disabled,
    and since it is easy to get the list of tests with this tag,
    it is not necessarily needed to create an issue for each flaky test. *)
val flaky : string

(** ["ci_disabled"]: disable test in the CI.

    The test is not to be run in the CI.
    You must provide a comment to explain why the test is disabled.
    For flaky tests, {!flaky} should be preferred to [ci_disabled]. *)
